## Release of Human-Rights-UNderstanding-CNNs

HRUN is the first ever image dataset of human rights violations photographs, labelled with human rights semantic categories,
comprising a list of the types of human rights abuses encountered at present.

### Data of Human Rights UNderstanding

Here we release the data of Human Rights UNderstanding to the public.
HRUN has been used to train various CNNs based on a deep representation learning tool for image classification with Matlab,
called [MatDeepRep](https://github.com/GKalliatakis/MatDeepRep "MatDeepRep's GitHub repo").

(HRUN) dataset consists of 4 different categories of human rights violations and 100 diverse images per category.
This dataset was constructed with the specific purpose of capturing a range of real world situations of common human rights violations (e.g. child labour, child soldiers etc.).

Images for all 4 violation categories can be directly accessed here [[download]](https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Human-Rights-UNderstanding-CNNs/releases/download/v1.0/HRUN.zip).

The per-category images can be downloaded here: [[child labour]](https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Human-Rights-UNderstanding-CNNs/releases/download/v1.0/child_labour.zip) [[child soldiers]](https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Human-Rights-UNderstanding-CNNs/releases/download/v1.0/child_soldiers.zip) [[police violence]](https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Human-Rights-UNderstanding-CNNs/releases/download/v1.0/police_violence.zip) [[refugees]](https://github.com/GKalliatakis/Human-Rights-UNderstanding-CNNs/releases/download/v1.0/refugees.zip)
